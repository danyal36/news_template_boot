                            <p>Yes, we all love java. It gets us going in the morning. And the afternoon. And the evening. But is it really such a good idea?
                              According to a Gallup poll, about two-thirds of American adults have at least one cup of coffee every day, averaging 2.7 cups of coffee per day,
                              and 25 percent of people claim they feel addicted to caffeine. Despite this, only 10 percent of people want to cut back on their coffee drinking.
                              These numbers haven't changed much, because our relationship with coffee hasn't changed much. We don't see coffee as a stimulant drug;
                              we see it as a natural way to reduce fatigue, improve alertness, improve focus and ultimately boost productivity (plus, many of us find it to be delicious).
                              There's evidence that supports all of these effects. But are those proofs as powerful as we believe them to be? And, are there darker,
                              less beneficial effects that are cancelling out the benefits, without our even knowing it?
                              The consumption of coffee is shown to improve memory and cognitive function. In fact, regular coffee drinking may even improve cognitive function overall as we age,
                              rather than providing just a short-term boost. Researchers from the Department of Psychiatry and Clinical Psychobiology
                              at the University of Barcelona found that caffeinated beverages, when consumed with glucose, improve "cognitive performance in terms of
                              sustained attention and working memory." Effectively, then, coffee improves performance. Drink a cup of joe and you'll remember more things from meetings, solve problems faster and be able to focus on (and complete) tasks more productively throughout the day.
                              Subjectively, most people agree that coffee also helps them feel better -- especially when they wake up feeling particularly tired or fatigued.
                              Ordinarily, feeling tired can leave you less alert and less focused, but coffee can help mitigate those effects --
                              and may also boost your physical performance (if your job requires anything physical).
